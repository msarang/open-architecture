              LOA is the first dynamic, living, and open roadmap for lunar exploration, 
              powered by an evolving database that captures and coalesces current and 
              future missions for lunar exploration.

              By tracking developments around the world in technologies, science
              industry, and policy, we hope to cultivate a participatory community to engage in collective
              decision making to reach shared objectives in lunar exploration.

                In addition to serving as a database, tracking developments in the space industry and advancements in our understanding of lunar science, we aim to create a tool that will empower individuals
                to collaborate to achieve shared objectives and goals. LOA will serve as a first step â€“ a place to share visions and goals for future lunar exploration. In an effort to uncover the diversity of 
                views and tacit knowledge that influences opinions and insights into developments in the space industry, we conducted a survey with senior members of the space industry to get their take on the next year, and decade,
                in lunar exploration. Explore their insights below.
